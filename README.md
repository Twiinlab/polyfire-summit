## talk overview:
In the talk we will show how to integrate Polymer component and FireBase, the Mobile Backend as a Service platform of Google, Realtime system and Hosting service. We will have also a little introduction to reactive programming, and how to build interactive applications taking advantage of this new approach with Polymer components in our apps to improve the user experience. To see all of this in action: We will end up developing an interactive application which will show the potential of this awesome synergy Polymer and Firebase, with a collaborative example ;)
